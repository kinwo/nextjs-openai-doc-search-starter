# Package Management

BeamFi utilizes [Vessel](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel) for 3rd party libraries package management.
It is a simple tool that allows you to manage your project's dependencies using `vessel.dhall` and `package-set.dhall` files.

**vessel.dhall** specifies the dependencies of your project and the MOC (Motoko) compiler version to use.

```js
{
  dependencies = [ "matchers", "crypto", "JSON" ],
  compiler = Some "0.8.3"
}
```

Currently, it uses `matchers` for unit testing, `crypto` for HMAC SHA256, and `JSON` for JSON parsing.
There are additional packages that are used by the above dependencies, and they are specified in **package-set.dhall**.

**package-set.dhall** specifies the remote location of the dependencies.

```js
let upstream = https://github.com/dfinity/vessel-package-set/releases/download/mo-0.6.21-20220215/package-set.dhall
let Package =
  { name : Text, version : Text, repo : Text, dependencies : List Text }

let
  -- HMAC SHA256
  additions =
    [
      { name = "crypto"
      , repo = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/crypto.mo"
      , version = "v0.3.1"
      , dependencies = ["base-0.7.3", "array", "encoding"] : List Text
      },
      { name = "base-0.7.3"
      , repo = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base"
      , version = "moc-0.7.3"
      , dependencies = [] : List Text
      },
      { name = "array"
      , repo = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/array.mo"
      , version = "v0.2.1"
      , dependencies = [ "base-0.7.3" ] : List Text
      },
      { name = "encoding"
      , repo = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/encoding.mo"
      , version = "v0.4.1"
      , dependencies = [ "base-0.7.3", "array" ] : List Text
      },
      { name = "JSON"
      , repo = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/json.mo"
      , version = "v0.2.1"
      , dependencies = [ "base-0.7.3", "parser-combinators" ] : List Text
      },
      { name = "parser-combinators"
      , repo = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/parser-combinators.mo"
      , version = "v0.1.2"
      , dependencies = [ "base-0.7.3" ] : List Text
      }
    ]

let overrides =
