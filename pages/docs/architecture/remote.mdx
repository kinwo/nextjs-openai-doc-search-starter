# Remote

[`remote`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/tree/main/backend/remote) is where the remote actor is kept. That can be Candid files for use by dfx.json to indicate the remote actor for example ICP ledger. It can also be a remote actor set via Motoko for example [XTC.mo](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/main/backend/remote/xtc/XTC.mo). In both cases, it tries to encapsulate the remote actor so that the caller does not need to know the details of the remote actor.
