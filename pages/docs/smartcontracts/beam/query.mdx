# Query Beam

To query Beams, you need to use the `queryBeamByEscrowIds` function. This function takes an array of EscrowIds and returns an array of BeamReadModels. The BeamReadModel is a subset of BeamModelV2. Treat it like a lightweight version of the BeamModelV2 - Value Object pattern.

```js
public query func queryBeamByEscrowIds(idArray : [EscrowId]) : async [BeamReadModel]
```

Usually, before calling queryBeamByEscrowIds, you will need to find a list of EscrowId from [BeamEscrow](/docs/smartcontracts/beamescrow/querymybeams) service using the user's identity principle.

Once you have the EscrowId, you can use `dfx` command line to retrieve the Beam streaming status.

For example, with EscrowId 0:

```bash
dfx canister beam queryBeamByEscrowIds "(vec{0})"
```

It should return something like this:

```js
(
  vec {
    record {
      id = 0 : nat32;
      status = variant { active };
      beamType = variant { payment };
      createdAt = 1_682_665_947_905_076_000 : int;
      escrowId = 0 : nat32;
      scheduledEndDate = 1_682_714_555_000_000_000 : int;
      startDate = 1_682_665_947_905_076_000 : int;
    };
  },
)
```

`active` means it is still being streamed.

The status could be:

```js
{ #created; #active; #paused; #completed }
```

When it has finished streaming, the full amount would be available for claiming. The status would be #completed.
