# Create a Beam EscrowContract with a relation object

Creating BeamEscrow EscrowContract with a relation object is very similar to [createBeamEscrow](/docs/smartcontracts/beamescrow/simplebeam) except that you need to provide the relation object id which would be used as index key in the relation object lookup and matching.

```js
public shared ({ caller }) func createRelationBeamEscrow(
  escrowAmount : TokenAmount,
  tokenType : TokenType,
  blockIndex : BlockIndex,
  dueDate : Time,
  buyerPrincipal : Principal,
  creatorPrincipal : Principal,
  objId : BeamRelationObjId
) : async Result<EscrowId, ErrorCode> {
```
