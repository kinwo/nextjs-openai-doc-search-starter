# Create a simple Beam EscrowContract with ICP tokens

The best way to experience creating BeamEscrow is to use DFX command line. We can't use Candid UI because it doesn't support caller identity from the web frontend.

## DFX Command Line

You can call the API directly from `dfx` command line. Sample commands can be found in [automated test scripts](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/main/backend/test/test-claim-reentrancy.sh).

## Create BeamEscrow EscrowContract

`createBeamEscrow` is the top-level service call to BeamFi. It will create an EscrowContract, BeamModel (by calling Beam Canister) and return the EscrowId. The EscrowId is the unique identifier for the EscrowContract.

```js
public shared ({ caller }) func createBeamEscrow(
  escrowAmount : TokenAmount,
  tokenType : TokenType,
  blockIndex : BlockIndex,
  dueDate : Time,
  buyerPrincipal : Principal,
  creatorPrincipal : Principal
) : async Result<EscrowId, ErrorCode>
```

Before calling `createBeamEscrow`, the caller needs to transfer the specified amount `escrowAmount` of tokens `tokenType` from their wallet which could be `dfx` command line, [Plug Wallet](https://plugwallet.ooo/) or [NFID Wallet](https://nfid.one/), etc.

After the transfer, record the blockIndex number and use it as input to `createBeamEscrow`.

For example, if you are using `dfx` command line, you can run the following command to check your ICP balance:

```bash
dfx ledger balance --ledger-canister-id $(dfx canister id ledger) $(dfx ledger account-id)
```

Run the following command to transfer 10 ICP tokens to the BeamEscrow canister:

```bash
dfx ledger transfer --ledger-canister-id $(dfx canister id ledger) --amount 10 --memo 2147483647 $(dfx ledger account-id --of-canister beamescrow)
```

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs"

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Notes: Memo must be number. We use 2147483647 here. You can use any number for
  your own reference.
</Callout>

After the transfer, it will return:

```
Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 1
```

Record the blockheight. It will be used as input to `createBeamEscrow`

`escrowAmount` is E8S format with a base of 8 zeros meaning for ICP e.g 1 ICP = 100000000 E8S. For XTC, it is base of 12.
`tokenType` is either `icp` or `xtc`.

`buyerPrincipal` is your Principal ID which you can get from:

```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```

`creatorPrincipal` is the Principal ID of the recipient which you can get by creating a new identity running the following in command line:

```bash
dfx identity new recipient1
dfx identity use recipient1
dfx identity get-principal
```

That will give you a new identity and Principal ID. You can use that Principal ID as the recipient.

`dueDate` is the target completion date of the payment streaming in epoch UTC in nanoseconds.

Run the following cmd to create a BeamEscrow EscrowContract with 10 ICP tokens, block index 1, due date 2023-05-27 15:49:15 UTC, buyerPrincipal is your Principal ID and creatorPrincipal is the recipient1 Principal ID.

```bash
dfx canister call beamescrow createBeamEscrow "(1000000000, variant { icp }, 1, 1682714555000000000, principal \"ktaun-mznjo-4w2qi-von4m-qodwj-hpm4t-d4yoo-dkzvz-7al2r-px72c-gae\", principal \"om674-h2bcd-bhoxu-2deg5-lqfv5-w7kea-oqsa2-rhtqu-o5jih-5xfc7-qae\")"
```

It will return the EscrowId in the format:

```
(variant { ok = 0 : nat32 })
```

0 is the EscrowId
