# Client SDK

We understand the importance of developer productivity. The current state of [Smart Contract API](/docs/smartcontracts) is just the beginning. In the future, we aim to provide client SDK in different languages like `TypeScript`, which will make it easier for developers to interact with the Smart Contract API in their familiar language without learning a new set of technology.

To make it happen, please `star` the [BeamFi Protocol](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol) Git repository and `watch` for updates. We will keep you posted.
