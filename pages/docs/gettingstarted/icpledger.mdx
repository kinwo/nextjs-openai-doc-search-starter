# Deploy ICP Ledger to local IC replicas

BeamFi has support for both ICP and XTC tokens.
This `Getting Started` guide demonstrates how to use BeamFi with ICP tokens.

### Setup Local Canister

This is a special step to lock the local ICP ledger canister ID to ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai for working with [Plug Wallet](https://plugwallet.ooo/) Local network `window.ic.plug.requestTransfer()` method.

That piece of code is hardcoded to use canister ID `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai` regardless of mainnet or local IC.

In order to get Create Beam working with Plug, a pre-configured `canister_ids_local.json` is used instead of letting IC local replica to assign one.

Copy it to `.dfx/local` which is where local IC replicas will store their states and configs.

```
> mkdir .dfx/local
> cp canisters_ids_local.json .dfx/local/canister_ids.json
```

In the next step when the ICP ledger is deployed to IC local replicas, it will use the ID stored in canister_ids.json instead of assigning a new one.

### Install Local ICP Ledger

ICP Ledger is a canister configured in dfx.json as a custom type.
It will be installed using the WASM file provided by Dfintiy. A sample of WASM can be found at `local/ledger/ledger.wasm`.

The detailed guide is here: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup

Assuming you have followed [`Local Environment`](/docs/gettingstarted/localdev) guide and started a local dfx IC replica.

- Update dfx.json ledger config to use private candid for deploying ledger

Open `dfx.json`  
Locate ledger -> candid  
Update the value from:

```
backend/remote/icp/ledger.public.did
```

to

```
backend/remote/icp/ledger.private.did
```

- Deploy ledger

```
> dfx identity new minter
> dfx identity use minter
> export MINT_ACC=$(dfx ledger account-id)
> dfx identity use default
> export LEDGER_ACC=$(dfx ledger account-id)
> dfx deploy ledger --argument '(record {minting_account = "'${MINT_ACC}'"; initial_values = vec { record { "'${LEDGER_ACC}'"; record { e8s=100_000_000_000 } }; }; send_whitelist = vec {}})'
```

If there is any error when deploying, check the dfx cmd again to make sure the single quote and double quote are correct.

- Update dfx.json ledger config to use public candid for building with other canisters in the next guide.

Open `dfx.json`  
Locate ledger -> candid  
Update the value back to:

```
backend/remote/icp/ledger.public.did
```
