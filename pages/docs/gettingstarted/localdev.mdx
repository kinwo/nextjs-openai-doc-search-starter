# Setup Local Development Development

## Development Environment Setup

- Install [NodeJS 16.19 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

If you have [NVM - Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, you can run the following command to install the correct version of NodeJS:

```
> nvm use
```

- VSCode Editor

Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't.

## Run local IC replicas

Open a separate new command line Terminal

```
> dfx start
```

## Setup Environment Config

To avoid unnecessary direct dependencies and circular dependencies in Motoko, the canister IDs are kept in backend/config/Env.mo.
Note that the canister IDs are different for local development and production deployment.

For local development, simply use the preconfigured EnvLocal.txt.

```
> cp guide/EnvLocal.txt backend/config/Env.mo
```
