# Verify - Run Automated Test Scripts

To verify your deployed BeamFi Canisters are running properly, a couple of automated tests are provided. It was automated as part of the BeamFi Continuous Integration process in GitHub, but you can also run it locally.

## Test - Restart Beam

This test will verify that the new beam can be stopped and restarted without any issues.

You will need ICP tokens. The good news is 100 ICP is minted to the default account when the local ICP ledger canister is deployed.

To run:

```bash
./backend/test/test-restart-beam.sh
```

### Main Flow

Please follow [`runTest`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/23101f93860397a4360aac7d4a4ac2bcf6e8f32d/backend/test/test-restart-beam.sh#L145) in [test-restart-beam.sh](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/main/backend/test/test-restart-beam.sh) for the main flow.

import { Steps } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
 
<Steps>
 
### Create Beam
It will transfer ICP tokens from the default identity to the BeamEscrow Canister.  
Then it calls `BeamEscrow.createBeamEscrow`to create a new `BeamEscrowContract` and return `EscrowId`.

### Stop Beam

It will call `BeamEscrow.stopBeam` to stop the `BeamEscrowContract`, verify the status is `paused` and the claimable amount is unchanged after the Beam is stopped.

### Restart Beam

It will call `BeamEscrow.restartBeam` to restart the `BeamEscrowContract` and verify the status is `active`. It will also check after some time, the claimable amount is bigger than before the Beam is stopped.

</Steps>

The output will look like this if it is successful:

```

## Test - Reentrancy Attack

This test will verify that the BeamEscrow Canister is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack with multiple claims at the same time. It is a relatively sophisticated test and requires a bit of understanding of the BeamFi protocol, Internet Computer and dfx cmd.

Follow [`runTest`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/23101f93860397a4360aac7d4a4ac2bcf6e8f32d/backend/test/test-claim-reentrancy.sh#L157) in [`test-claim-reentrancy.sh`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/main/backend/test/test-claim-reentrancy.sh) for the main flow.

To run:

```bash
./backend/test/test-claim-reentrancy.sh
```
