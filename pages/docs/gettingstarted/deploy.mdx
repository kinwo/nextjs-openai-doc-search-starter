# Build & Deploy BeamFi to local IC replicas

We will now build and deploy BeamFi Motoko smart contracts to canisters: `beam`, `beamout`, `beamescrow`, `monitoringagent`
You can find the configs in `dfx.json`.

Run:

```
> dfx deploy
```

This cmd will compile and deploy all canisters to the local IC. It will take a while to complete.  
Once it is built, you can find the canister IDs in .dfx/local/canister_ids.json .

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs"

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Be aware that the root folder canister_ids.json stores the canister IDs
  deployed to IC mainnet.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Note that `deploy` does both build (~compile) and deploy to IC canisters.
In the future, while you are doing development, you can build one canister using `dfx build`.

e.g compiling only beamout, run:

```
> dfx build beamout
```

</Callout>
