# Deploy your own BeamFi Vault

## What is BeamFi Vault

BeamFi is an open-source real-time money-streaming protocol. While you can use the current one deployed to the public IC mainnet directly in your project, you can also deploy your own BeamFi Protocol smart contracts to IC mainnet and customize/enhance it for your purpose.

Each instance of BeamFi smart contracts is called a BeamFi Vault. You can deploy as many BeamFi Vaults as you want to IC mainnet. Each BeamFi Vault is independent of the other and has its own set of smart contracts and properties.

Imagine a new BeamFi Vault that has DAO governance enabled to resolve conflicts between users. Or a new BeamFi Vault that has special integration to a specific DeFi protocol to earn passive income by providing liquidity while money is idle. The possibility is endless.

Soon, the BeamFi app would be enhanced to make connections to different BeamFi Vaults and allow users to switch between them.

## Deploy new BeamFi Vault to Internet Computer IC mainnet

### Pre-requisites

Given that you have followed [Getting Started](/gettingstarted/quickstart) guide, you should have the following installed:

- NodeJS
- DFX CLI
- Vessel Package Management Tools

### Setup DFX identity

When you install DFX CLI, it comes with the default identity.

List all identities:

```bash
dfx identity list
```

Switch to `default` identity:

```bash
dfx identity use default
```

We recommend using a new identity for deployment to IC mainnet so that you can have a better separation of control among your identities.

For example, we create a new identity called `icprod` for deployment to IC mainnet.

```bash
dfx identity new icprod
```

Switch to `icprod` identity.

```bash
dfx identity use icprod
```

### Prepare Cycles consumed by Canister

Internet Computer uses cycles as the native token to pay for computation. You need to have cycles in your wallet to pay for the computation cost of creating and deploying canisters. To obtain cycles, you need to convert ICP tokens to cycles.

If you come from an Ethereum background, you can think of cycles as gas and ICP tokens as ETH.

[Learn more about ICP and Cycles](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/cycles/)

Dfinity provides free Cycles for new developers to get started. You can request free cycles from [IC Developer Portal](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/cycles/cycles-faucet).

You can also buy ICP tokens from exchanges like Kraken or Binance, transfer them to your dfx identity and convert them to Cycles.

### Clean up existing Canisters IDs config

If you have deployed BeamFi Vault before, you may have a `canister_ids.json` file in the project root folder. You can delete it now.

```bash
rm canister_ids.json
rm canister_ids_dev.json
rm canister_ids_prod.json
rm canister_ids_local.json
```

Note that `dfx` uses only canister_ids.json. The other files are for our copies of different environments. We delete them for now.

### Create empty canisters

Assuming you have obtained cycles and have them in your wallet, you can now create your own BeamFi Vault in IC mainnet.

We will create empty canisters first so that we can get the canister IDs and update the environment variables required for full deployment.

```bash
dfx canister --network ic create beam
dfx canister --network ic create beamescrow
dfx canister --network ic create beamout
dfx canister --network ic create monitoragent
```

Retrieve Canister IDs:

```bash
dfx canister --network ic id beam
dfx canister --network ic id beamescrow
dfx canister --network ic id beamout
dfx canister --network ic id monitoragent
```

You can also find them in `canister_ids.json` in the project root folder.

### Update Env Configs

BeamFi uses a number of environment variables to configure the deployment. You can find the list of environment variables in `Env.mo` file.

Export each of the keys below as an environment variable.

E.g. to export `CLIENT_KEY` as an environment variable, run the following command.

```bash
export CLIENT_KEY=YOUR_SECURE_KEY_STRING
```

| Key Name                 |                                                                                                       Description                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| CLIENT_KEY               | HTTPS API Request Client Key. It is used by all http_request http_request_update methods to verify the http client as basic protection. Simply generate a secure random string of about 26 chars using Password Manager |
| BEAM_ESCROW_CANISTER_ID  |                                                                                  BeamEscrow Canister ID. Get it from the previous step                                                                                  |
| BEAM_CANISTER_ID         |                                                                                     Beam Canister ID. Get it from the previous step                                                                                     |
| MONITORAGENT_CANISTER_ID |                                                                                 MonitorAgent Canister ID. Get it from the previous step                                                                                 |
| BITCOIN_NETWORK          |                                                                              Bitcoin Network to connect to. Leave it to `Regtest` for now                                                                               |
| ZOOM_SECRET_TOKEN        |                                                                             Zoom Developer Account API Secret Token. Leave it empty for now                                                                             |

Having configured the environment variables, you can now run the script to update Env.mo.

```bash
./scripts/update-env.sh
```

Open Env.mo to verify the environment variables are all updated correctly.

### Build & Deploy

This is the final step to deploy your own BeamFi Vault to IC mainnet.

It will compile Motoko files to Wasm files, build canisters and deploy them to IC mainnet.

```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

At the end of the deployment, you should see the following output.

```bash
Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.

URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    beam: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=***
    beamescrow: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=***
    beamout: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=***
    monitoragent: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=***
```

You can now verify the deployment by visiting the URLs above by replacing \*\*\* with the canister ID.

E.g. if your beam canister ID is `2ekax-oqaaa-aaaah-qc6qa-cai`:

Open this URL in Chrome:  
https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=2ekax-oqaaa-aaaah-qc6qa-cai

Check that it has the correct Smart Contract API.

If you would like to deploy an individual canister, you can run the following command.

For example, to compile and deploy `beam` canister.

```bash
dfx deploy --network ic beam
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully deployed your own BeamFi Vault to IC mainnet. Well done!
