# BeamFi Integration with Zoom

The full integration with Zoom is done in 3 parts: BeamFi protocol, BeamFi App, and BeamFi Meeting App (Zoom Web Client).
The following diagram illustrates the architecture of BeamFi integration with Zoom.

[BeamFi Beam canister](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/7db9b0267bb6b1d67d71cdabfb57925e8c5ad8de/backend/service/Beam.mo#L353) is integrated with [Zoom using Webhook](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/webhooks/#operation/meeting.started) via [IC HTTP Gateway Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#http-gateway).

It is done by exposing [`http_request`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/7db9b0267bb6b1d67d71cdabfb57925e8c5ad8de/backend/service/Beam.mo#L353) and [`http_request_update`](https://github.com/BeamFi/BeamFiProtocol/blob/7db9b0267bb6b1d67d71cdabfb57925e8c5ad8de/backend/service/Beam.mo#L375) func in Beam canister.

`http_request_update` func allows Beam canister to receive a Zoom Webhook event when a meeting is started. The event is then processed by the Beam canister which would update the state of the beam and BeamEscrowContract in the BeamEscrow canister.

If you are interested in setting up your own BeamFi integration with Zoom locally, it will require a Zoom developer account and a network tunnel for ingress-as-a-service e.g [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your localhost securely as Webhook URL in Zoom Webhook configs. The scope of it is beyond this documentation. Feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:support@beamfi.app) if you need help with it.
