# BeamFi App - Web Frontend Integration

To make testing BeamFi Protocol easier, we have developed a web frontend [BeamFi App](https://beamfi.app) to interact with the BeamFi Protocol. This section describes how to integrate the BeamFi App with your local BeamFi Protocol canisters.

## Setup Development Environment

- Clone Git Repository: https://github.com/BeamFi/beamapp.git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BeamFi/beamapp.git
```

- Install [NodeJS 16.19](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or if you have [Node Version Manager - NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

```bash
nvm use
```

- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- Install Extensions: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Update local BeamFi canisters IDs

- switch to BeamFi Protocol Git repo folder in your local machine
- copy .dfx/local/canisters_id.json to your BeamFi App Git repo .dfx/local/canisters_id.json so that the BeamFi App can find your local BeamFi Protocol canisters IDs when building

```bash
cd $YOUR_LOCAL_BEAMFI_PROTOCOL_GIT_REPO_FOLDER
cp .dfx/local/canisters_id.json $YOUR_LOCAL_BEAMFI_APP_GIT_REPO_FOLDER/.dfx/local/canisters_id.json
```

Replace $YOUR_LOCAL_BEAMFI_PROTOCOL_GIT_REPO_FOLDER and $YOUR_LOCAL_BEAMFI_APP_GIT_REPO_FOLDER with your local folder paths.

- switch to BeamFi App Git repo, copy .env.iclocal to .env.development so that the BeamFi App can connect to your local BeamFi Protocol canisters

```bash
> cp .env.iclocal .env.development
```

## Build & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome. It should show the BeamFi App home page like that in [production](https://beamfi.app/).

If it works, well done! 🎉

## Setup Plug Wallet

To Create Beam in BeamFi App, it requires Plug Wallet configured to Local IC network and ICP ledger.

### Install Plug Wallet

Install [Plug Wallet Chrome extension](https://plugwallet.ooo/) version 0.6.1.2 or higher if you haven't.

To configure Plug Wallet to use Local ICP Ledger:

- Get the local ICP Ledger canister id configured in [Getting Started](/docs/gettingstarted/icpledger)

```bash
> dfx canister id ledger
```

- Click on the network switch button "Mainnet" on top, click "Add" to add a local network.

```

Network Name: Local
Host URL: http://localhost:8000
Ledger Canister Id: {Put the ledger canister id from above}

```

- Switch to "Local". It should show 0.000 ICP if it works.

### Create 2 Accounts

When you install Plug Wallet, one account is created. To test Beam, we need 2 separated accounts.

- Create another account here:

![Create Account](/guide/images/CreateAccount.png)

### Transfer ICP from default identity account to your Plug Wallet

To create Beam, you will need some ICP tokens. When deploying a local ICP ledger above, 100 ICP is minted to the default identity account.

- Switch to default identity

```bash
dfx identity use default
```

- Get your ledger canister ID

```bash
dfx canister id ledger
```

- Get your Plug Wallet Account ID
  Open Plug Wallet -> Click Deposit.

Copy Account ID there.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs"

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Note: If you wonder what is the difference between Principal ID and Account
  ID, read this:
  https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/#accounts
</Callout>

- Transfer 10 ICP from your default identity account to your Plug Wallet Account ID 1

```bash
> dfx ledger transfer --ledger-canister-id {local ledger canister id} --icp 10 {Plug Wallet Account Id} --memo 1
```

## Create Beam from BeamFi App

Now, you should have everything you need to create Beam from Beam frontend app.

- open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome
- Click "Create Beam" and follow the instruction to deposit ICP and create beam to another Plug Wallet principal ID
- After the Beam is created sucessfully, go to My Beams:

If you see the following and the Beam rate is updating continuously. Congratulations! 🎉

You have achieved an incredible job!
