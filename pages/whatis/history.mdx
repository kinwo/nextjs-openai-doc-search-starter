# History of BeamFi

The original idea of BeamFi (previously called Beam) came from the development of Content Fly (a decentralized job marketplace for creators) escrow payment smart contracts. Both co-founders - Sam and Henry were brainstorming a new innovative payment solution that would allow creators or job freelancers to receive a continuous stream of payment in a trustless way without waiting for the job completion that could be weeks or months away.

## Birth of BeamFi

A POC (Proof of Concept) was therefore developed for Supernova Hackathon in July 2022. It was integrated into Content Fly as a payment solution for creators. The POC was a success and has become one of the top 7 finalists in the Supernova Hackathon DeFi category. The team decided to further develop Beam as a standalone product which is now called BeamFi. It has the ambition of being a protocol, smart wallet, ecosystem and App marketplace.
